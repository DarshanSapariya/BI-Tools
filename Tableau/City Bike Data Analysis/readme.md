# City bike Data Analysis 🏍️🛣️

Hi! I have done my analysis using **Tableau**. [Here](https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_16428710015770/Story1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) you can access it.
> Dataset is in the repository itself

**Overview**

The Dataset contains various information columns such as tripdurations, star- end locations' names, co-ordinates, biker's age, gender, etc.
Created various Dashboards such as 
- Year-Wise Analysis Dashboard
- Station Comparision Dashboard
- Top-N Metrics Dashboard
- Pivot Dashboard
> All Dashboards you can view saperately From my Tableau link

Using These Dashboards, I created an **Storyline** which gives a complete overview of dataset.

This storyline is helpful capturing many KPI (Ket Point Informations), such as:
- How many trips have been recorded totsl during the chosen period?
- How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
- What are the peak hours in which bikes are used durring summer and winter months?
- Today based on the data, What are top 10 stations in the city for
	- Starting journey
	- Ending Journey
- Also, What are bottom 10 stations in the city for
	- Starting Journey
	- Ending Journey
- What is the gender breakdown of active participants?
- etc.

 Try analysing it by yourself, and Have Fun!
